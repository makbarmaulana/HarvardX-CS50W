Design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.

## Build With

* HTML
* CSS (SCSS)

## Specification

* Have three pages: one for regular Google Search, one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search.

1. On the Google Search page, there is links in the upper-right of the page to go to Image Search or Advanced Search and back to regular Google Search.

* On the Google Search page, the user should able to type in a query, click “Google Search”, and be taken to the Google search results for that page.

1. Like Google’s own, Search bar centered with rounded corners. The search button also centered.

* On the Google Image Search page, the user able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.

* On the Google Advanced Search page, the user able to provide input for the following five fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options) :

1. Find pages with… “all these words:”
2. Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
3. Find pages with… “any of these words:”
4. Find pages with… “none of these words:”
5. Then narrow your results by… “site or domain:”

* Like Google’s own Advanced Search page, the form stacked vertically, and all of the text fields left aligned.

1. Consistent with Google’s own CSS, the “Advanced Search” button colored blue with white text.
2. When the “Advanced Search” button is clicked, the user will be taken to the search results page for their given query.

* Add an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the main Google Search page. Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking this link will take users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.

* The CSS resemble Google’s own aesthetics.
